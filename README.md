# Hiring Pipeline

The goal of this project is to find talented individuals for technology companies by leveraging a Machine Learning (ML) pipeline. 
The pipeline automates and streamlines the talent acquisition process, resulting in reduced costs and improved efficiency. 

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to find the best matching candidates based on how fit these candidates are for a given role. 
Through Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning, the pipeline aims to identify the most suitable candidates for specific roles based on their LinkedIn information.

## Dataset

## Methodology

The pipeline conducts searches based on role-specific keywords, such as "full-stack software engineer" or "Aspiring human resources." 
These keywords may vary depending on the specific role requirements. NLP capabilities, such as NLTK and sbert Sentence Transformers, are leveraged to provide semantic embeddings for candidate descriptions. 
This facilitates the matching process with the specific needs of recruiters.

### Candidate Screening and Ranking

The ML pipeline screens and ranks job candidates based on their LinkedIn information. 
By analyzing the descriptions provided by candidates, the pipeline identifies the most suitable candidates for a given role. 
This automated screening process significantly reduces the manual effort required for candidate evaluation.

### Continuous Learning Mechanism

The pipeline is equipped with a continuous learning mechanism that utilizes manual supervisory signals. 
Recruiters can provide feedback by starring or flagging candidates, which is then used to update the ranking algorithm. 
This feedback loop ensures ongoing improvement and consistent delivery of better results over time.

## Usage

To utilize this talent acquisition ML pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Define role-specific keywords based on the requirements of the position.
2. Acquire candidate descriptions from LinkedIn or other relevant sources.
3. Run the algorithm to extract semantic embeddings from candidate descriptions.
4. Use the pipeline to screen and rank the candidates based on the extracted embeddings and specific recruiter needs.
5. Provide manual supervisory signals, such as starring or flagging candidates, to improve the ranking algorithm over time.

## Conclusion

This ML pipeline optimizes the talent acquisition process for technology companies by automating candidate screening and ranking. 
By leveraging NLP capabilities and continuous learning mechanisms, the pipeline significantly reduces costs and streamlines the hiring process. 
The automated screening and ranking of candidates based on their LinkedIn information ensures that the most suitable candidates are identified for specific roles. 
With ongoing improvements and feedback from recruiters, the pipeline consistently delivers better results and enhances the overall efficiency of the talent acquisition process.
